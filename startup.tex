Your
majesty,
your
people
are
starving
in
the
streets,
and
threaten
revolution.
Our
enemies
to
the
west
are
weak,
but
they
threaten
soon
to
invade.
What
will
you
do?
\begin{description}
%{
%{
%CASE(Make pre-emptive war on the western lands.)
\item[Make pre-emptive war on the western lands.]
%{
%{
If
you
can
seize
their
territory,
your
kingdom
will
flourish.
But
your
army's
morale
is
low
and
the
kingdom's
armory
is
empty.
How
will
you
win
the
war?
\begin{description}
%{
%{
%CASE(Drive the peasants like slaves; if we work hard enough, we'll win.)
\item[Drive the peasants like slaves; if we work hard enough, we'll win.]
%{
%{
Unfortunately,
morale
doesn't
work
like
that.
Your
army
soon
turns
against
you
and
the
kingdom
falls
to
the
western
barbarians.

%CASE(Appoint charismatic knights and give them land, peasants, and resources.)
\item[Appoint charismatic knights and give them land, peasants, and resources.]
%{
%{
Your
majesty's
people
are
eminently
resourceful.
Your
knights
win
the
day,
but
take
care:
they
may
soon
demand
a
convention
of
parliament.

%Case found
%CASE(Steal food and weapons from the enemy in the dead of night.)
\item[Steal food and weapons from the enemy in the dead of night.]
%{
%{
A
cunning
plan.
Soon
your
army
is
a
match
for
the
westerners;
they
choose
not
to
invade
for
now,
but
how
long
can
your
majesty
postpone
the
inevitable?

%{

The
westerners
have
you
at
the
point
of
a
sword.
They
demand
unfair
terms
from
you.

Eventually,
the
barbarian
westerners
conquer
you
anyway,
destroying
their
bread
basket,

the
entire
region
starves.

wheat.

The
kingdom
descends
into
chaos,

you
manage
to
escape
with
your
own
hide.
Perhaps
in
time
you
can
return
to
restore
order
to
this
fair
land.
